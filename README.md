## Blind 75 Questions

This section contains solutions to the **Blind 75** list of coding interview questions. These questions are known for covering the most important concepts and are frequently asked in technical interviews.


## Sorting Algorithms

This section includes implementations of various sorting algorithms:

- [Bubble Sort](./sorting/BubbleSort.java)
- [Selection Sort](./sorting/SelectionSort.java)
- [Insertion Sort](./sorting/InsertionSort.java)
- [Merge Sort](./sorting/MergeSort.java)
- [Quick Sort](./sorting/QuickSort.java)
- [Heap Sort](./sorting/HeapSort.java)

## Graph Problems

Explore graph-related problems, including traversal techniques like BFS, DFS, and problems like:

- [All Paths From Source to Target](./graph/AllPathsSourceTarget.java)
- [Shortest Path Algorithms](./graph/ShortestPath.java)
- [Cycle Detection](./graph/CycleDetection.java)

## Tree Problems

This section contains problems related to binary trees, binary search trees, and general trees:

- [Binary Tree Traversals](./trees/BinaryTreeTraversals.java)
- [Lowest Common Ancestor](./trees/LowestCommonAncestor.java)
- [Tree Serialization/Deserialization](./trees/TreeSerialization.java)

## Basic Interview Questions

Here you'll find solutions to common live coding questions that often come up in technical interviews:

- [Two Sum](./interview/TwoSum.java)
- [Reverse a Linked List](./interview/ReverseLinkedList.java)
- [Palindrome Check](./interview/PalindromeCheck.java)
- [Anagram Check](./interview/AnagramCheck.java)
